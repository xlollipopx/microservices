# Blockchain implemented in Scala + Akka


Project description
-------------------
  
This is a simplified custom blockchain that is implemented on Scala with Akka. Each computer that run this app is a node in 
peer2peer network. When someone installed the app and wants to become a part of the peer2peer network, he need to add some seed node address to
connect. When someone wants to make a transaction and write it to the blockchain, this transaction will be sent to other nodes and validated by them.
Also when some node mined a block, this block is broadcasted to other nodes and validated by them, and when validation is successful, block is added 
to the blockchain.

##Mining
To mine a block you need to solve the cryptographic task: 
if current block hash doesn't contain n zeros in the beginning, we increase nonce field by one and do this step until we have n zeros in the beginning
of the hash. Hash is evaluated using all field in the block.

These functions(in BlockChain class) are used to mine blocks:


      def generateNextBlock(blockData: String): Block
      final def mine(block: Block): Block 
      

Also we can fast and easily check if a block was mined in a legal way(this is called proof of work):


      def validBlock(newBlock: Block, previousBlock: Block): Boolean =
        previousBlock.index + 1 == newBlock.index &&
        previousBlock.hash == newBlock.previousHash &&
        calculateHashForBlock(newBlock) == newBlock.hash
        


Build and run
-------------


The app can be run using docker-compose.

First build docker image:

    sbt docker:publshLocal


Then run

    docker-compose up

This will start 4 nodes, which will first connect to node1 (the seed node) and then proceed to build a P2P network.

To create an account use:

    curl -v -H POST http://localhost:9000/signup -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"http://localhost:9000", "password":"admin" }'
    
As a username use server local address.

Visualisation:

Open  blockchain-ui and run:

    npm run serve
